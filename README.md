> Looking back on these examples ... I feel Python is ugly.

[Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) makes so much more sense to me: the syntax, the structure, it's functional style, typed data, and so on. I'm stripping this back to the absolute essentials of Python, which is to say as little as possible to get the job done.


## Questions

- Perhaps Python is handy for certain applications?
- Perhaps a functional style is possible?
- Perhaps you just need to memorise syntax differences?


## Goals

1. Build a simple API
2. SQLite and Json
3. Minimal backend code
4. Minimal server setup

That's about it. I need something that interfaces with a simple database, keeping things light. It's for prototypes, and will probably be replaced by another programming language at some stage. [Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org/) looks promising, but I'm not a heavy coding guy, so might have a team by then!
