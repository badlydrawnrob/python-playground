# Pydantic's settings documentation is waaaay too confusing â€”Â the books example
# is outdated (dependeny hell) and it's not as simple to achieve. You might want
# to use an alternative, such as `python-decouple` which seems far simpler
# (although not as robust). You can find more information here:
