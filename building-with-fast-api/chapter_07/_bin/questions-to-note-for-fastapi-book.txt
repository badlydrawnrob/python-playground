6. UNDO a recent delete (can be really helpful with forms)
    - I've accidentally deleted or refreshed the page a few times

## Simplifying data (perhaps)

1. Store events properly with data normalisation
2. Cycle through events per user and ...
3. Store them in a user.eventsList json blob?

Would this make life easier when trying to interface between the SQL and REST Api? Another person mentioned doing things this way while clarifying the schema (partially schema-less) and migrating data properly with ACID later.
