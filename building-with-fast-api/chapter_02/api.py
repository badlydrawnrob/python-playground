# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A to do app
# ==============================================================================
# Uvicorn cannot use the `APIRouter()` instance directly to serve the application,
# like we did with `uv run uvicorn api:app --port 8000 --reload`. We've got to
# add these routes to the `FastAPI()` instance to enable their visibility.
#
# Include router
# --------------
# `include_router(router, ...)` method is responsible for adding routes defined
# with `APIRouter` class to the main application's instance.
#
# - `app` variable now has an instance of the `FastAPI` class.
# - `.include_router` is a method of this class
#
# Notes
# -----
# > You should have an authenticated user and some way to store both
# > a login token and CSRF for forms: some method of TRUST per user.
# > Never share your login token with anyone else! (especially Github etc)
#
# 1. Beware of duplicates (`:id`)
# 2. Beware of empty lists
# 3. Beware of mutating lists (use `.copy()`?)
# 4. Beware of malicious input (validate and SANATIZE)
# 5. Beware of irriversible changes (`DELETE` all)
