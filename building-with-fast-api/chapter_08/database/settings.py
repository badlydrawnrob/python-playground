# Pydantic's settings documentation is waaaay too confusing â€”Â the books example
# is outdated (dependency hell) and it's not as simple to achieve. There's other
# options, such as `python-decouple` which seems far simpler (although not as
# robust). More information here:

# Notes
# -----
# > Fucking programming is so annoying ..
#
# 1. For some reason, dictionaries aren't allowed in `.env` files ...
#    - So serialize  (convert) dictionary to a `json` string
#    - And decode with `json` where it's needed 
#    - Make sure negative numbers are valid in JSON

    DATABASE: Optional[str] = None
    PRAGMA_SETTINGS: Optional[str] = None #! `.env` files don't do dictionaries (1)
    SECRET_KEY: Optional[str] = None #! Our functions don't allow `None` (strict)
