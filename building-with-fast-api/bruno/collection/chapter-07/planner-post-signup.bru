  > We're currently using `User` for both request body **and** the SQL `add()` to database!
  
  Our `User.ID` and `User.events` are `Optional`.

  > You might want to enforce fields on the client-side, say for user preferences. Or, you could create a `UserRequest` with `BaseModel`?
  
  This might not be the ideal way to do it, as it's not separating concerns between the API request and the SQL schema.
