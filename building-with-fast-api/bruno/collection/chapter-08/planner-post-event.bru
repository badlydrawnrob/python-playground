  # 🐞 Bugs
  
  1. **Foreign keys are `NULL`able by default**
      - So I've left in `.creator` as `null` ...
      - This should **not** pass validation however ...
      - As `.creator` is **not** in `Event` API layer
  2. **`exclude_none=True` is set so (1) validates** 
      - If this is set to `False` (1) should fail!
  3. 🕰 **Slow response time?**
      - Because we have to get the `BaseUser.id` first!
