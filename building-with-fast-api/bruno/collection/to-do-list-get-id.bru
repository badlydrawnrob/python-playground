  # To Do
  
  Here we're getting whatever `id` passed into the url. If the `:id` doesn't exist, or if the list is empty, return an error message.
  
  ## 🐞 Bugs
  
  1. Our `POST` accepts duplicate `id`s, so we'll need to fix that.
  2. This will only return the _first_ `:id` of that kind (even if there's 2 of them)
