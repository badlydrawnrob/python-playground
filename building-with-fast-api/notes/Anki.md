##Â Terminology

> The difference between Elm type modules,
> and Python classes, methods, stateful stuff.

You can rip a lot of this stuff from the book, but put it in very simple terms. Perhaps your Ai can help you do this, in the form of flashcards for simplicity?

- Basic Git terminology
- A class instance (such as `FastAPI()`)
- Basic syntax differences
    - `function()` calls and arguments
    - Typing (just a taste)
    - Python [comments](https://realpython.com/python-comments-guide/)
- The `app` variable (I guess this holds the state)
- Models (Elm has one master model)
- Decorators
- A route and route handler (with images)
    - what is a path, query params, urls
    - what is a request, request body, response body
    - RESTful elements and actions
    - Code responses (does not exist) etc
